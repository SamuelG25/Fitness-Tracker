# Fitness-Tracker

In this repository we have two files (fitnesstracker.java and testFitness.java)

We will begin will talking about the fitnesstracker.java file.This file is used to create objects. In this file ultize the 
Java.time.localdate and Java.time.month. After we import the needed files we create the variables (activity, minutes, and date)
needed to support the program. After the variables are we create the constructor which takes three agruements for each varible
and stores it to the right variable. We then go own to create get mehtods for each variable which simply uses the return functions
to return the requested variable. 

Next We will talk about the testfitnesstracker.java. This porgram is used to test the fitnesstracker.java file. In this program 
we also import the Java.time.localdate which we will use to change the date. We then create three objects from the fitnesstracker file. 
While creating these objects we also give the agruements needed which is the activity name, minutes ,and date. After the objects are
created we then utilize the get methods that were created in the fitnesstracker.java file and give the information for each exercise.

Below is a example of the output.![Screenshot (33)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74160231/109456375-53e42400-7a1e-11eb-8219-61fd81f8de20.png)
